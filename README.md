Learning on the fly as I build my first chrome extension! This chrome extension will be one of my first real world project ideas, it'll be an email scam detector. 
This is ideally taliored made for older users who are more likely to get scam/spoof emails. What this chrome extension will do is analyze the email the user gets, and will give a score 
on how reliable and safe the email is or if its more than likey a scam.
